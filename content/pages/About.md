### I better write them down.

This idea flashed through my mind after coding and playing with electronics for a certrain years.

I didn't make it serious until I read [the Zen](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/).

And I think to myself, it is the right timing to write them down.

### Who am I?
Engineer speaking in Python, C, Verilog and solder.
